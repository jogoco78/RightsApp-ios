In order to obtain particularized information, the user has to fill in a small questionnaire (with a minimum of X and a maximum of Y questions). Once the user has answered this questionnaire, the rights that assist the user in her/his specific situation will appear grouped by subject (this grouping is due to the size of mobile devices’ screens, in order to facilitate the visualization). Once the title of any subject has been pressed, a more detailed definition of the rights that assist the user with respect to that subject will be displayed.\nIn the latter scenario the app provides the citizen who has been the victim of a crime with information regarding entities and centres that provide crime victim support. First, the user chooses three parameters to facilitate the search among these institutions and centres. The first parameter is the type of entity you are looking for, the second indicates in which country, and finally in which city. At the moment, only entities and centres that provide assistance to victims of crime in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia are available. Once these parameters are established, an ordered list will appear from less to more distant with respect to the user's location. Once one of the entities or assistance centres has been selected, the app will offer the possibility of calling that particular entity or centre, navigating to it (using GoogleMaps) or going back to carry out another search.";
